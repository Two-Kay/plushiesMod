# Plushies

A mod that adds plushies to Rimworld!

## Features

- Craft cute plushies at the tailoring bench!
- Plushies are similar to sculptures, but made from textiles
- Cute artwork descriptions that make sense for plushies!
- Attach up to 10 plushies to a bed to give a small stacking comfort bonus
- Sleeping in a bed with a plushie gives a "Cuddled plushie" thought (+1)
- "Psychopath" colonists are not too excited about plushies...
- but "Kind" colonists really like plushie cuddles and get +3!
- Colonists can also spend their free time cuddling plushies to gain joy!

## Compatibility

Plushies are patched in as linkables for anything with "Bed" in the defName, so it should work with mods like Vanilla Furniture Expanded.
